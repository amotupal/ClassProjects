This repository contains practice codes from the course 
[CSE 591: Deep Learning for Visual Computing](http://www.ragav.net/cse591)
during the Spring of 2017 at Arizona State University. The codes here are only for illustrative 
purposes.

Every code will have its own setup instructions and such, but most code involve python, scipy and 
related libraries to be installed.
